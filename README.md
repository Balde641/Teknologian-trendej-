                                          Teknologian trendej√§ (Technology trends):
                                          
1. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the biggest pillars of our generation and next generation in terms of the technology industry, as there is increased demand for the use of machine learning (ML) and connectivity between humans and connected objects.
With advances in AI, our daily routine or activities are radically changing in many ways. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our society.

2. Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a very good device to deal with, because it has the capability to hold saved data even if the power is turned off.
So, we are not risking to lose saved data when the power suddenly breaks, that is a very important difference compared to the volatile memory, which only maintains its data while the device is powered.

3. Digital Twin is changing the way we create and optimize AI and IoT technology. 
Thanks to the use of sensors, cameras and other data collection techniques, virtual representation which corresponds to physical attributes becomes more and more interesting and helps companies to be efficient in terms of reproduction of physical object in a virtual way.
This technology will allow us to better understand the structure of real objects.

4. AI and critical systems is a very important subject to address, because on the one hand, it helps us to tackle daily challenges such as improving public health, safety and well-being . On the other hand, the public fears that freedom will diminish under the dependence of objects powered by AI, as we can be under surveillance with our connected objects.

5. Practical delivery drones could be one of the most important sectors of the tech industry in the near future, due to the high increase in online shopping. This logistical means of delivering packages could be a very important industry, even if today it is a bit of a nightmare to have in practice, but it should not be overlooked at all.

6. The practice of 3D printing is increasing due to its precision and its sophisticated way of manipulating, polishing and trimming unusual objects to make them useful tools.
The 3D printing industry is massively modernized.

7. Cognitive skills for robots. Robots have to replace humans in a harsh environment to do more efficiently what is difficult for humans to do physically.
Even if some think that robots steal our jobs, they are in fact complementary tools for the production of goods and services.

8. AI / ML applied to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is today one of the main risks for any country, business and individual, due to the growing attack and the sophisticated way in which the attacks are carried out.
In one way, the benefit of AI / ML improves our daily lives, but in the other, when AI / ML is used to harm others, it is very pathetic and can lead to disaster. One of the most important goals today is to protect our data from malicious hacking.

9. Due to the high threat of cybersecurity, current legislation must also be tough against anyone or any nation trying to use technology as a weapon to unjustly harm or destroy other competitors.
The public must be more educated to be able to tell the difference between fake news or anything that is false on the Internet than that which is not.

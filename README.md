                                          Teknologian trendej√§ (Technology trends):
                                          
1. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the biggest pillars of our generation and next generation in terms of the technology industry, as there is increased demand for the use of machine learning (ML) and connectivity between humans and connected objects.
With advances in AI, our daily routine or activities are radically changing in many ways. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our society.

2. Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a very good device to deal with, because it has the capability to hold saved data even if the power is turned off.
So, we are not risking to lose saved data when the power suddenly breaks, that is a very important difference compared to the volatile memory, which only maintains its data while the device is powered.

3. Digital Twin is changing the way we create and optimize AI and IoT technology. 
Thanks to the use of sensors, cameras and other data collection techniques, virtual representation which corresponds to physical attributes becomes more and more interesting and helps companies to be efficient in terms of reproduction of physical object in a virtual way.
This technology will allow us to better understand the structure of real objects.

4. AI and critical systems is a very important subject to address, because on the one hand, it helps us to tackle daily challenges such as improving public health, safety and well-being . On the other hand, the public fears that freedom will diminish under the dependence of objects powered by AI, as we can be under surveillance with our connected objects.
